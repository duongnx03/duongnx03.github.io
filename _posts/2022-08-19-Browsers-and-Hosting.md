## What is hosting?
``` 
Hosting is a storage space divided from the server to help users upload data
(text, content, images, files,...), publish websites or applications on the Internet. 

When using a hosting system, you put on the provider's server the necessary data 
files for your website or online application to run.

Hosting providers are responsible for keeping the servers up and running. It also
ensuresthat the hosting provision goes smoothly. They will prevent server intrusion, 
and process data from hosting to the user's browser.

### Hosting works
 Service providers will prepare hosting servers for hosting users. By sharing resources on the server into smaller storage spaces. Hosting tenants only need to upload files to the hosting and configure them to work. Users can access hosting from internet-connected devices, by sending requests to the domain name or IP address of the hosting. And then the hosting will return the requested files accordingly.
-Depending on the package that users register, the provider will configure these hosting for users to use. During use, if there is a need to shrink or expand the hosting package, the user must contact the provider to be done, the provider will adjust these parameters.

Hosting is used to store the website's content, mail service, FTP, etc. Without hosting, the website can only work on your computer. Only you can see and use that website. With web hosting, anyone can search and access your website if they have the correct domain name or IP address.
