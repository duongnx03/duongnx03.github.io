# Data Structures: Stack
## I. Conceptual
### What is the Stack?
![stack](https://cafedev.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cafedev-of-stack.png)
 _The stack is also a linear data structure and it contains an ordered data set._

 Stacks provide three methods for interaction:

+ push: adds data to the _“top”_ of the stack.
+ pop: get the _top_ element off the stack.
+ peek: returns data from the "top" of the stack without removing it.

 - Unlike queue, stack uses Last In First Out(LIFO) or First In Last Out(FILO) structure.

**You can think of a stack of books as a way to organize a booklet in your home:**
![stack](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Stack%20Article%20-%20Soni/stack-of-book.jpg)

  Each book has information (data). The first book you add (push) to the cabinet is both the top and bottom of the stack. Each added book becomes the new top of the stack.

  Every time you want to read a book you can only take out the top one (pop) because if you take it from below the stack will spilled.

  You can look through and read the title of the top book without taking it off the stack(peek).
  
## II. Ideas
**Below we will implement a stack using single-link list:**

  Stacks can be implemented using a linked list as the underlying data structure because it’s more efficient than a list or array.

   The top of the stack is equivalent to the top node of the linked list, and the bottom of the stack is equivalent to the tail node.

One limitation that can be placed on a stack is its size. This is done to limit and quantify the resources the data structure will use when it is "full".

Pushing data onto a full stack will result in a stack overflow.
Similarly, if you try to pop data from an empty stack, it will result in a flow under the stack.

**More detail:**

+ First, create a Class to create the nodes of a linked list. 
Inside it, initialize a constructor that takes a node (value) as a parameter

+ Next, create a Stack class
Inside it:
  Create a constructor that takes size as a parameter, set head and tail with nil => empty stack

  We will do Pop, Push, Peek and Display operations:
1. Pop: Insert a new element at the top of the stack, i.e. insert a new element at the beginning of the linked list.
  
2. Push: Get the top element of the Stack, i.e. just remove the first element from the linked list.

3. Peek: provide the data of the first element of the stack.

4. Display:  Print all elements in Stack.

## III. Implementation








## IV. Recap
+ Stacks process data Last In, First Out (LIFO)

+ Stack is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.

+ Stack provide three methods for interaction:

  push: adds data to the “top” of the stack
  pop: get the first element out of the stack
  peek: provide the data of the first element of the stack without deleting it

+ Can be implemented using a linked list or array

+ There may be a size limit

+ Pushing into a full queue causes a stack overflow

+ Taking an element from an empty stack causes underflow.
