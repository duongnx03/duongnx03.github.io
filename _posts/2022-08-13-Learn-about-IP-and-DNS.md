 DNS (Domain Name Systym) invented in 1984 is a system that allows to establish correspondence
between IP addresses and domain names on the Internet. Simply put, it is a system that helps
convert numeric IP addresses (for example, 66.220.149.25) to domain names that are easy for
humans to remember (for example, youtobe.com) and vice versa.

#### Uses

It serves the user as a "Phone Book", capable of searching and translating domain names into
IP addresses. It stores a huge amount of information and is tied to fixed IP addresses.
Domain names are easier for users to remember than complex IP addresses.


#### Function

 DNS can be understood as an "interpreter" and "communicator".
When opening a Web browser and entering the website name, the browser will go directly to the
website without having to go through the IP address of the website. The DNS helps each other to
translate "IP" addresses into "names" and vice versa. The user only needs to remember the "name",
no need to remember the IP address.
