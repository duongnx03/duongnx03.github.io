## Process Management 
### What is process?
`Simply put, when an application, program is launched or executed, it is called
a process,a program can run many processes.`

### How process work?
`A Process will include the program code and its operations. Depending on the 
operating system (OS), a Process can be made up of multiple Threads to execute
instructions concurrently.
It is conceivable that when you create a game or an application, such a program 
will include your own instructions or lines of code. When that program runs, it 
is a process and does the work of executing those lines of code.`

### What is Process Management?
 `A program can have more than 1 process that can request the same resource
at the same time => There must be a system to manage processes and resources 
effectively or else the program may crash. inconsistency and deadlock.`
