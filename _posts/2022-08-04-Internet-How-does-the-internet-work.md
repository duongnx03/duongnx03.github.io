 The internet is the world most popular computer network. It began research in 1969 and became
a global commercial network in the 1990s. Currently, there are early 5 billion people  using the
internet in the world and that number is still growing

 No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. The internet is a network of networks.
Each of the separate networks belongs to different companies and organizations, they rely on
physical servers in different countries with varying laws and regulations.

 Most people access internet using a web browser. It became so popular that many people consider
internet and web synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one of many internet applications.
In addition, there are many other popular applications.
