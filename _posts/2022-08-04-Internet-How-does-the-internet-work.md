### How to transfer data from computer to another one?

 Data is transmitted from one computer to another in the form of bits (10110101010010100100) through
various media such as Ethernet cables, wireless signals (wifi-radio wares) and fiber optic cables 

### Bits and byte
1. Bits(binary digit) is the smallest unit used to represent information in a computer and is also used  
 to measure the transmission speed of information over a network. It is written binary (0 and 1).

2. Bytes is the smallest data storage unit in a computer memory. 1 byte represents 256 stale value of information,
1 byte represent the number 0-255.
