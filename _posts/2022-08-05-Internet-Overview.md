# Internet Overview

### What is the internet?  

The internet is global network of interconnected computing devices to communicate and share 
information with each other.

You can imagine the internet consists laptop, TV, cleaner robot, camera ip they are able to connect to internet.


#### Who was created the internet?
  Vint Cerf - "father of the internet" and and his colleague Robert E. Kahn who co-designed 
the TCP/IP protocol and the architecture of the internet. In December 1997, President Bill
Clinton presented the U.S nation medal of Technology 

#### Who is control the internet?
  No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. The internet is a network of networks.
Each of the separate networks belongs to different companies and organizations, they rely on
physical servers in different countries with varying laws and regulations.


#### Internet usage
 The internet is the world most popular computer network. It began research in 1969 and became
a global commercial network in the 1990s. Currently, there are early 5 billion people  using the
internet in the world and that number is still growing

 Most people access internet using a web browser. It became so popular that many people consider
internet and web synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one of many internet applications.
In addition, there are many other popular applications.

#### Internet components

 There are three basic components of the internet:
 1. Client- which is the computer that connects with a remote computer or server to request information.

 2. Server- which is the computer that provides service or shares resources to the client.
  This functionality of client and server work on a model called - call and response.
  It performs serveral tasks to provide the most relevant and accurate information for 
  each request and fast execution time.

 3. Protocol- which is a set of functions that need to be followed to find the desired data

  The Protocols are crucial elements of the internet. It's difined as a set of rules that guide
 the transmission of data beetwen computing devices. The rules make sure that the data request is 
 sent and received by the client without any problem.
  There are two important protocols:
1. Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)
2. Internet Protocol (IP)

  Each computer divice has a unique IP adress, it helps computers recognize each other more easily.
 The TCP/IP protocols make the data request and receiving possible between to computers via server.

## How does the internet work?

### How to transfer data from computer to another one?

 Data is transmitted from one computer to another in the form of bits (10110101010010100100) through
various media such as Ethernet cables, wireless signals (wifi-radio wares) and fiber optic cables 

#### Bits and bytes 
1. Bits(binary digit) is the smallest unit used to represent information in a computer and is also used  
 to measure the transmission speed of information over a network. It is written binary (0 and 1).

2. Byetes is the smallest data storage unit in a computer memory. 1 byte represents 256 stale value of information,
1 byte represent the number 0-255.
